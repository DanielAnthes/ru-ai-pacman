This file contains all of the agents that can be selected to 
control Pacman.  To select an agent, use the '-p' option
when running pacman.py.  Arguments can be passed to your agent
using '-a'.  For example, to load a SearchAgent that uses
depth first search (dfs), run the following command:

> python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -a searchFunction=depthFirstSearch

Commands to invoke other search strategies can be found in the
